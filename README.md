## goal

To experiment with using veraPDF, and maybe other tools, to check PDF accessibility.

To be determined:
- how to set up veraPDF
- how to call it from a python script
- how to evaluate the results
    - do we want to eventually have "handlers" to auto-address certain issues?
    - do we want binary pass/fail results, or return a list of issues, or something else?


## installation

- from https://verapdf.org/software/ clicked the [veraPDF for Mac link][mac-link]
